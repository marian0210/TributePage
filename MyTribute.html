<h3>Some facts of this great province:</h3>
<ul class="center">
    <li>
        Is a province of Argentina, located in the western part of the country.
    </li>
    <li>The province has an area of 89,651 km2, covering a mountainous region with scarce vegetation, 
        fertile oases and turbulent rivers. Throughout the entire province there are an important
        number of paleontological sites
    </li>
    <li>Agriculture is one of the most important economic activities, highlighting wine production
            and olive oil. This is the second province in volume of wine production at the national level
            and in South America, and possesses outstanding varietal wines. It is also an important center
            of mining and oil production.
    </li>
    <li>Before the arrival of Spanish conquistadores, different tribes like Huarpes, Diaguitas, Capazanes,
         Olongastas and Yacampis, highly influenced by the Inca empire, inhabited the area.
    </li>
    <li>The city of San Juan de la Frontera was founded by Juan Jufré y Montesa in 1562 and
         relocated 2 kilometres south in 1593 due to the frequent flooding of the San Juan River.
    </li>
    <li>San Juan concentrates most of its population in the oases or central valleys, Tulum Valley, Zonda,
        Ullum and Jáchal, containing nearly 80% of this population. The remaining is located in the oasis
        located at the foot of the Andes in Iglesias and Calingasta. Another population concentration 
        is in Fertile Valley.
    </li>
    <li>The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly
        elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the
        Supreme Court.</li>
